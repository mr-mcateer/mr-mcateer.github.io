          "I graded the quiz. Some of you nailed it. Some of you... did not. The class average
          was around 80%, and I saw the same questions missed by multiple people. So today we're
          going to walk through the engine part by part, and I'm going to make sure every single
          one of you can tell me what each component does and WHY it matters. No notes &mdash;
          just listen and look."<br><br>
