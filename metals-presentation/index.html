          <strong>WELCOME &amp; OPENING (2 min)</strong><br><br>
          Welcome to our unit on metal types. Just like we learn to identify different species of wood
          in woodworking, in metals class we need to be able to identify and understand the properties
          of different metals — because choosing the wrong metal for a job can mean the difference
          between a project that lasts a lifetime and one that fails on day one.<br><br>
          <strong>Key question to pose:</strong> "If I handed you two pieces of metal that looked almost
          identical, how would you tell them apart?" (Let students brainstorm — weight, magnetism, color,
          spark test). We'll come back to this.

        <h2>What About Metal?</h2>
        <aside class="notes">
          <strong>TRANSITION (1 min)</strong><br><br>
          In woodworking, students learn to tell the difference between hardwoods and softwoods —
          oak vs. pine, maple vs. cedar. Each one has a color, a grain, a hardness, and a best use.<br><br>
          Metals are the same way. Steel isn't just "steel." Aluminum isn't just "aluminum."
          There are families, grades, and alloys — and each one behaves differently when you
          cut it, weld it, bend it, or finish it.<br><br>
          Today we're going to build your metal vocabulary so you can walk into any shop and
          know what you're working with.

          <strong>KEY CONCEPTS (5 min)</strong><br><br>
          This is the single most important classification in metals. Write "Ferrous" and "Non-Ferrous"
          on the board.<br><br>
          <strong>Ferrous</strong> comes from the Latin word <em>ferrum</em> meaning iron — that's why iron's
          chemical symbol is Fe. ANY metal that contains iron as its primary ingredient is ferrous.<br><br>
          <strong>Quick demo idea:</strong> Grab a magnet and walk around the shop. Touch it to different
          metals. If it sticks → ferrous. If it doesn't → non-ferrous. This is the simplest field
          test students will ever learn.<br><br>
          <strong>Why it matters practically:</strong><br>
          • Ferrous metals RUST. If a student leaves a mild steel project unfinished without primer,
            it will have surface rust by Monday.<br>
          • Non-ferrous metals resist corrosion naturally — that's why aluminum is used for aircraft
            and copper for plumbing.<br>
          • Welding parameters are completely different between ferrous and non-ferrous.<br><br>
          <strong>Check for understanding:</strong> "Is stainless steel ferrous or non-ferrous?" (Trick question —
          it IS ferrous because it contains iron, but the chromium content prevents rust. Good discussion starter.)

          <strong>RELEVANCE CONNECTION (3 min)</strong><br><br>
          This is the "so what?" slide. Students need to understand that metal selection isn't
          academic — it directly affects their shop work.<br><br>
          <strong>Analogies to woodworking they may know:</strong><br>
          • Just like sanding oak takes longer than sanding pine, machining stainless takes way
            longer than machining aluminum.<br>
          • Just like you wouldn't use balsa wood for a load-bearing shelf, you wouldn't use
            aluminum where you need the strength of steel.<br><br>
          <strong>Real consequences in our shop:</strong><br>
          • If you try to MIG weld aluminum with steel wire → contaminated weld, no fusion, scrapped part.<br>
          • If you run lathe speeds for steel when cutting aluminum → clogged tool, bad finish.<br>
          • If you pick stainless when mild steel would work → you just tripled your material cost.<br><br>
          <strong>Engagement prompt:</strong> "Has anyone ever tried to drill through something and the
          drill bit just squealed and smoked? What probably happened?" (Wrong speed/feed for the
          material hardness.)

          Mild steel is the bread and butter of any metals shop. If students only remember one
          metal from this entire unit, it should be this one.<br><br>
          <strong>The naming system:</strong><br>
          • "1018" is an AISI/SAE grade. The "10" means plain carbon steel, the "18" means 0.18%
            carbon. Low carbon = soft, ductile, weldable.<br>
          • "A36" is an ASTM structural grade — same family, slightly different spec. Most of the
            flat bar, angle iron, and tube in our shop is A36.<br><br>
          <strong>Identification tips:</strong><br>
          • Fresh-cut mild steel is silvery grey. But it usually has dark blue-grey "mill scale"
            (oxide layer from hot rolling).<br>
          • It's magnetic — always sticks to a magnet.<br>
          • Spark test: long, white, branching sparks with lots of forks (carbon bursts).<br>
          • It WILL rust if you leave it bare. Oil it or prime it.<br><br>
          <strong>In our shop:</strong><br>
          • This is what we weld in MIG — ER70S-6 wire, C25 gas (75% argon / 25% CO2).<br>
          • It machines beautifully on the lathe and mill. Forgiving for beginners.<br>
          • Almost every first project in metals class is mild steel because it's cheap and forgiving.<br><br>
          <strong>Analogy:</strong> "Mild steel is to metals class what pine is to woodworking —
          it's cheap, it's everywhere, it's easy to work with, and it's what you learn on."

          If mild steel is the pine of metals, 6061 aluminum is the poplar — lighter, softer,
          and very versatile.<br><br>
          <strong>The naming system:</strong><br>
          • "6061" — the "6" means it's alloyed with magnesium and silicon. The "061" is
            the specific recipe. 6061 is by far the most common aluminum alloy in general fabrication.<br>
          • You'll also see "6061-T6" — the T6 means it's been heat treated and artificially aged
            for maximum strength. T6 is harder to bend but stronger.<br><br>
          <strong>Identification tips:</strong><br>
          • Bright silver-white color — much lighter looking than steel.<br>
          • Pick it up — it's shockingly light. About 1/3 the weight of the same size piece of steel.<br>
          • NOT magnetic. Magnet slides right off.<br>
          • No spark on a grinder — aluminum doesn't spark.<br>
          • Leaves a silvery smear if you rub it on concrete.<br><br>
          <strong>In our shop:</strong><br>
          • Machines FAST — you can run 2-3x the spindle speed compared to steel.<br>
          • BUT: aluminum is "gummy." Chips can weld to your cutting tool if you don't use
            the right speed/feed and cutting fluid.<br>
          • Welding aluminum requires different everything: aluminum wire, 100% argon gas, AC
            current (TIG) or special MIG setup.<br>
          • Can't mix aluminum and steel chips in the recycling — keep bins separate!<br><br>
          <strong>Where you see it:</strong> Bike frames, aircraft, boat hardware, phone cases, laptop
          bodies, car wheels. If it needs to be light and strong, it's probably 6061.

          Stainless steel is the most misunderstood metal in the shop. Students assume it's
          "just fancier steel." It's actually a completely different animal to work with.<br><br>
          <strong>The naming system:</strong><br>
          • "304" is the most common grade — the "kitchen sink" stainless. 18% chromium, 8% nickel.
            Also called "18-8."<br>
          • "316" has added molybdenum for even better corrosion resistance — used in marine and
            medical applications.<br>
          • The chromium (minimum 10.5%) reacts with oxygen to form an invisible, self-healing
            protective layer. That's what makes it "stainless."<br><br>
          <strong>Identification tips:</strong><br>
          • Looks similar to mild steel when freshly ground, but stays bright — doesn't form
            mill scale or rust.<br>
          • Slightly heavier than mild steel if you compare same-size pieces.<br>
          • Magnet test is unreliable — some stainless is slightly magnetic, some isn't.<br>
          • Spark test: short, dark-red sparks with very few forks (low carbon).<br><br>
          <strong>Critical shop rules:</strong><br>
          • NEVER use a grinding wheel, wire brush, or flap disc on stainless that has been used
            on carbon steel. Carbon particles embed in the stainless surface and cause rust spots.
            This is called "cross-contamination."<br>
          • Keep dedicated stainless tools marked separately.<br>
          • Stainless "work hardens" — if you go too slow on the lathe or drill press, the
            surface gets harder and harder. Keep feeds aggressive and cutting tools sharp.<br><br>
          <strong>Where you see it:</strong> Kitchen appliances, food processing, surgical instruments,
          boat railings, handrails, architectural features. Anywhere corrosion resistance matters
          more than cost.

          <strong>MIG WELDING OVERVIEW (5 min)</strong><br><br>
          MIG welding is the first welding process most students learn because it has the
          shortest learning curve.<br><br>
          <strong>How to explain it simply:</strong><br>
          "Imagine a hot glue gun, but instead of glue, it feeds metal wire. And instead of
          heating it with electricity in the gun, there's an electrical arc between the wire
          and the workpiece that's about 6,000&deg;F. The shielding gas is like an invisible
          bubble that keeps oxygen away from the molten puddle."<br><br>
          <strong>Key settings students need to understand:</strong><br>
          • <strong>Wire speed</strong> — controls how much filler metal goes into the joint.
            Too much = big, blobby weld. Too little = no fusion.<br>
          • <strong>Voltage</strong> — controls the arc length and heat. Higher voltage = wider,
            flatter bead. Lower = narrower, taller bead.<br>
          • <strong>Travel speed</strong> — how fast you move the gun along the joint. This is
            the hardest thing for beginners to get consistent.<br><br>
          <strong>Common beginner mistakes:</strong><br>
          1. Holding the gun too far from the workpiece (arc goes everywhere)<br>
          2. Moving too fast (cold, ropy bead with no penetration)<br>
          3. Not cleaning the metal first (porosity — tiny holes in the weld)<br>
          4. Wrong polarity (DCEP for MIG — wire is positive)<br><br>
          <strong>Safety callout:</strong> Never look at the arc without a welding helmet (minimum
          shade 10). Even a brief flash can cause "arc eye" — feels like sand in your eyes,
          starts hurting hours later. No UV exposure is safe.

          <strong>LATHE TURNING OVERVIEW (5 min)</strong><br><br>
          The lathe is one of the oldest machine tools — it's been around in some form for
          thousands of years. But it's still one of the most important machines in any shop.<br><br>
          <strong>The key concept:</strong><br>
          "On a lathe, the WORK spins and the TOOL stays still. This is the opposite of a drill
          press or mill where the tool spins. Because the work spins, everything a lathe makes
          is round." Draw this distinction clearly — students often confuse which is moving.<br><br>
          <strong>Speed matters — A LOT:</strong><br>
          • Aluminum can handle high RPMs because it's soft and conducts heat away quickly.<br>
          • Stainless steel needs LOW RPMs because it work-hardens. If students go too slow on
            the feed, the surface gets harder with each pass, and eventually the tool just rubs
            instead of cutting. This destroys the tool and the workpiece.<br>
          • Rule of thumb: softer metal = faster RPM, harder metal = slower RPM.<br><br>
          <strong>Safety — absolute non-negotiables:</strong><br>
          1. <strong>NEVER leave the chuck key in the chuck.</strong> If the lathe starts, that key
             becomes a projectile. This is the #1 lathe safety rule.<br>
          2. No loose clothing, gloves, or jewelry near a spinning lathe. Long sleeves get
             rolled up. No gloves (they catch and pull your hand in).<br>
          3. Safety glasses at ALL times — chips are hot and sharp.<br>
          4. Stand to the side of the chuck, not in front of it, when starting the machine.<br><br>
          <strong>Common operations students will do:</strong><br>
          • Facing — cutting the end flat<br>
          • Turning — reducing the diameter<br>
          • Drilling — center drill first, then drill bit in the tailstock<br>
          • Chamfering — putting a 45&deg; angle on edges

          <strong>MILLING OVERVIEW (5 min)</strong><br><br>
          If the lathe makes round things, the mill makes everything else — flat surfaces,
          square shapes, pockets, slots, and complex contours.<br><br>
          <strong>The key concept:</strong><br>
          "On a mill, the TOOL spins and the WORK stays still (but moves on a table).
          The cutting tool has multiple flutes (cutting edges) that each take a small bite
          as they spin." Contrast this with the lathe where the work spins.<br><br>
          <strong>Types of operations:</strong><br>
          • <strong>Face milling</strong> — using the bottom of the end mill to flatten a surface.
            Like using a hand plane on wood, but with a spinning cutter.<br>
          • <strong>End milling</strong> — cutting with the side of the tool. Makes walls, steps,
            and profiles.<br>
          • <strong>Slot cutting</strong> — plunging the end mill in and cutting a channel.
            Like a router cutting a dado in wood.<br><br>
          <strong>Material-specific tips:</strong><br>
          • Aluminum: use 2 or 3 flute end mills (more room for chips to evacuate).
            Aluminum chips are big and can clog a 4-flute cutter.<br>
          • Steel: 4 flute is fine. Slower RPM, moderate feed.<br>
          • Stainless: sharp tools are critical. A dull end mill on stainless work-hardens
            the surface and creates a vicious cycle of heat and hardening.<br><br>
          <strong>Safety:</strong><br>
          • Workpiece MUST be securely clamped in the vise. A loose workpiece that catches
            the cutter can become a projectile or shatter the end mill.<br>
          • Clear chips with a brush, never your hands — they're razor sharp and hot.<br>
          • Safety glasses mandatory. Face shield recommended for heavy cuts.

          <strong>COMPARISON & REVIEW (5 min)</strong><br><br>
          This is your summary slide. Use it for quick review or as a reference during
          hands-on activities.<br><br>
          <strong>Activity idea:</strong> Hand out unmarked samples of each metal. Have students
          use what they've learned (magnet test, weight comparison, visual inspection) to
          identify each one. They can use this chart to check their answers.<br><br>
          <strong>Discussion questions:</strong><br>
          • "You're building an outdoor railing. Which metal do you choose and why?"
            (Stainless or aluminum — both resist corrosion. But stainless is stronger.
            Mild steel works too if you powder coat or galvanize it.)<br>
          • "You're making a go-kart frame on a budget. What do you pick?"
            (Mild steel — cheap, easy to weld, plenty strong.)<br>
          • "You're machining a lightweight bracket for a drone. What do you use?"
            (6061 Aluminum — light, machines easily, plenty strong for the load.)<br><br>
          <strong>Key takeaway to emphasize:</strong> There's no "best" metal. There's only the
          best metal FOR THE JOB. Every choice is a trade-off between strength, weight,
          cost, corrosion resistance, and workability.
