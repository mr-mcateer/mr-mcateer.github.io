            <!-- 1. Core Job Statement -->
            <h2>Core Job Statement</h2>
            <p>The Jobs-to-Be-Done framework asks one question: what progress is the customer trying to make? People do not buy LED disc games. They hire a solution to a social problem. Frisbeam exists at the intersection of nighttime play, group bonding, and the desire to be the person who makes gatherings unforgettable.</p>

            <div class="callout">
              <strong>Primary Job</strong>
              "Help me create memorable social experiences that extend into the night."
            </div>

            <p>This is the core hiring criteria. Every product decision, marketing message, and customer touchpoint should ladder back to this job. The LED glow is not a feature. It is the mechanism that unlocks an entirely new window of outdoor play that competitors cannot touch. When the sun goes down, most outdoor games stop. Frisbeam starts.</p>

            <div class="data-table--scroll">
              <table class="data-table">
                <thead>
                  <tr>
                    <th>Job Dimension</th>
                    <th>What It Means</th>
                    <th>Why It Matters for Frisbeam</th>
                  </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                  <tr>
                    <td><strong>Situation</strong></td>
                    <td>Hosting an outdoor gathering that will continue after sunset</td>
                    <td>Most social events peak in the evening. Frisbeam is purpose-built for this moment.</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td><strong>Desired Progress</strong></td>
                    <td>Keep the group engaged, active, and together</td>
                    <td>The LED visual spectacle draws people in rather than letting them drift to their phones</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td><strong>Expected Outcome</strong></td>
                    <td>Be remembered as the host who created something special</td>
                    <td>Glowing discs at night are inherently shareable and memorable. The product markets itself.</td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
            </div>

            <!-- 2. Functional Jobs -->
            <h2>Functional Jobs</h2>
            <p>Functional jobs describe what the product physically needs to accomplish. These are the practical, measurable requirements that determine whether Frisbeam can actually get the job done. For an LED outdoor game, the bar is higher than a standard daytime product because the technology must perform reliably in conditions most games never face.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Set up quickly (under 2 minutes)</strong> - The game needs to go from trunk to play-ready before the group loses interest. No tools, no complicated assembly, no hunting for batteries. LED components should activate with a single switch or automatic motion sensor.</li>
              <li><strong>Play in low-light and complete darkness</strong> - This is the primary functional differentiator. The LED system must produce enough brightness to track the disc in flight, illuminate the target zone, and create a visible play area without external lighting. Performance in darkness is not a bonus feature. It is the entire value proposition.</li>
              <li><strong>Accommodate varying group sizes (2 to 10+)</strong> - The game must scale from a casual two-person toss to a full party rotation. Rules should support teams, tournaments, and drop-in/drop-out play so nobody is left standing on the sideline watching.</li>
              <li><strong>Transport easily to different locations</strong> - LED games add weight and fragility compared to standard outdoor equipment. The carrying solution must protect electronic components while staying light enough that one person can haul it from the car to the park, beach, or campsite.</li>
              <li><strong>Last through weather and repeated use</strong> - Outdoor play means exposure to dew, light rain, sand, dirt, and temperature swings. The LED system, battery housing, and disc materials must be weather-resistant. A product that dies after one wet evening fails the job permanently.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="callout callout--warning">
              <strong>Functional Threshold</strong>
              Battery life is the silent deal-breaker. If the LEDs dim or die mid-game, the entire value proposition collapses. Target minimum: 8 hours of continuous play on a single charge. Customers should never have to think about power during a single evening event.
            </div>

            <!-- 3. Emotional Jobs -->
            <h2>Emotional Jobs</h2>
            <p>Emotional jobs describe how the buyer wants to feel during and after using the product. These internal, personal feelings drive satisfaction far beyond functional performance. For an LED game, the emotional stakes are amplified because the visual spectacle creates stronger reactions than a standard yard game ever could.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Feel like the person who elevates the gathering</strong> - The buyer wants to be the one who transforms a regular evening into something special. Pulling out glowing discs after dark is a deliberate hosting move that signals effort, creativity, and generosity. The game is an extension of their identity as someone who makes things better.</li>
              <li><strong>Create "wow" moments</strong> - There is a specific instant when the LEDs first light up in the dark and the group collectively reacts. That moment of surprise and delight is what the customer is actually purchasing. Every design decision should protect and amplify that initial reaction.</li>
              <li><strong>Feel connected to friends and family</strong> - Screens isolate. Outdoor LED games do the opposite. The buyer wants to feel present, engaged, and genuinely connected to the people around them. The glow creates a shared focal point that pulls everyone into the same experience.</li>
              <li><strong>Escape screen time</strong> - There is a growing guilt and fatigue around phone use at social events. Frisbeam offers a guilt-free alternative that is genuinely more entertaining than scrolling. The buyer wants to feel like they chose something real over something digital.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="data-table--scroll">
              <table class="data-table">

                    <td>"I planned something great."</td>
                    <td>Guests notice the glow and start asking questions before the first throw</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td><strong>Create "wow" moments</strong></td>

                  <tr>
                    <td><strong>Feel connected</strong></td>
                    <td>"This is what I needed."</td>
                    <td>Laughter around the glow ring, phones forgotten in pockets</td>
                  </tr>
                  <tr>
                    <td><strong>Escape screens</strong></td>
                    <td>"Nobody is looking at their phone."</td>
                    <td>The visual spectacle is more interesting than any app notification</td>
                  </tr>
                </tbody>
              </table>
            </div>

            <!-- 4. Social Jobs -->
            <h2>Social Jobs</h2>
            <p>Social jobs describe how the buyer wants to be perceived by others. These are external, identity-driven motivations that influence which solution gets hired. LED games have an outsized advantage here because they are inherently visible, photogenic, and conversation-starting.</p>

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Be seen as the fun and creative host</strong> - Owning an LED disc game signals that this person prioritizes memorable experiences and knows how to curate them. It communicates the same values as a quality speaker system or a well-stocked cooler: this person puts thought into how their guests feel.</li>
              <li><strong>Give groups a shared activity</strong> - Large gatherings fragment. People cluster into small conversations, drift to their phones, or leave early. The buyer wants a tool that gives the entire group a reason to stay together, interact, and participate in something communal.</li>
              <li><strong>Create shareable social media moments</strong> - Glowing discs in the dark are inherently photogenic and video-friendly. The buyer wants content that performs well on Instagram and TikTok without staging or editing. The product should look impressive in a casual phone video shot from 20 feet away.</li>
              <li><strong>Build traditions and repeat experiences</strong> - The buyer wants Frisbeam to become "the thing we always do" at family reunions, annual camping trips, or weekly neighborhood hangouts. The game should create rituals and inside jokes that compound over time.</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="callout callout--success">
              <strong>Social Multiplier</strong>
              Every social media post featuring Frisbeam at night is free advertising with built-in "wow" factor. The product's visual distinctiveness means organic content performs better than paid ads from competitors selling non-illuminated games. Design the product to look spectacular on camera without effort.
            </div>

            <!-- 5. Consumption Chain -->
            <h2>Consumption Chain</h2>
            <p>The consumption chain maps every stage of the customer journey from first awareness through advocacy. Each stage presents friction points where the customer might abandon the process and opportunities where Frisbeam can outperform every alternative in the LED outdoor game space.</p>

            <!-- 6. Competitive Alternatives -->
            <h2>Competitive Alternatives</h2>
            <p>From a JTBD perspective, competition includes anything the customer could hire to solve the same job: creating memorable social experiences that extend into the night. The competitive set is broader than other LED games. It includes every option a host considers when planning evening entertainment.</p>

              <strong>Key Competitive Insight</strong>
              Frisbeam's most dangerous competitor is not another game. It is inaction: the customer deciding that "we will just hang out and see what happens" is good enough. Every marketing message should make the case that a gathering with Frisbeam after dark is a fundamentally different experience than one without it. The LED glow is the wedge that separates Frisbeam from every non-illuminated alternative.

            <h2>Switching Triggers</h2>
            <p>Switching triggers are the specific moments and circumstances that push a customer from their current solution (or non-consumption) toward purchasing Frisbeam. Understanding these triggers allows us to time marketing, position messaging, and design the purchase experience around the exact moment demand is highest.</p>

              <strong>Trigger Timing</strong>
              The highest-intent moment is Thursday through Saturday when customers are planning weekend gatherings. Schedule email sends, retargeting, and social posts to land during this window. A customer who sees Frisbeam on Thursday afternoon and has a Saturday barbecue planned is the ideal conversion scenario.

            <h2>Barriers to Adoption</h2>
            <p>Barriers are the anxieties, uncertainties, and habits that prevent a customer from switching to Frisbeam even after a trigger event. Overcoming these barriers is not about convincing the customer the product is good. It is about reducing the perceived risk of making a bad purchase decision.</p>

              <strong>Barrier Priority</strong>
              "Is it just a gimmick?" is the most dangerous barrier because it attacks the core value proposition. Every piece of content must demonstrate that the LED experience gets better with repeated play, not worse. Testimonials from customers on their 20th or 50th game are more valuable than first-impression reviews.
