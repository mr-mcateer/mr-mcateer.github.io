    <!-- ========== ORIGIN STORY ========== -->
    <section class="section">
      <div class="container--narrow">
        <div class="reveal">
          <p>It started the way most good ideas do -- after dark, with friends, and a feeling that something was missing. We were out at a backyard hangout one summer night, music going, people laughing, and someone grabbed a disc to toss around. Within ten minutes it was too dark to see anything. The night was young, but the game was over. That felt wrong.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="reveal">
          <p>We looked around for something -- anything -- that would let us keep playing outdoors after the sun went down. What we found was disappointing. A few novelty glow products that broke after one use. Some DIY tape-and-flashlight setups that looked terrible. Nothing that felt like a real game, designed from the ground up for nighttime play. So we decided to build one ourselves.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="reveal">
          <p>The first Frisbeam prototype was rough. LED strips held on with zip ties, a target that barely stood up, and a disc that was more flashlight than flying object. But we brought it to a friend's camping trip and something happened. People who had been sitting around the fire got up. Strangers introduced themselves mid-game. Someone asked if they could buy it. We knew we were onto something.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="reveal">
          <p>Over the next year, we tested and rebuilt at backyard parties, beach bonfires, music festivals, and late-night park sessions. Every version got better because real players told us what worked and what did not. We dialed in the LED brightness so it glows without blinding anyone, engineered the disc weight for actual flight performance, and redesigned the target until setup was a one-minute job. We were not trying to build a brand. We were trying to extend the best part of the night.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="reveal">
          <p>Frisbeam is not backed by a big corporation. There is no boardroom, no investors pushing us to cut corners. We are a small crew of people who believe the best moments happen when you put your phone down and actually play together -- especially after dark, when the glow changes everything. Every decision we make comes back to one question: does this make the after-dark experience better? If yes, we do it. If not, we skip it.</p>

            <h3>Glow Different</h3>
            <p>We did not just stick LEDs onto an old game and call it innovation. Frisbeam was designed from scratch for nighttime play -- the light output, the color modes, the way it looks mid-flight. Every detail is engineered to create something that feels genuinely new when the sun goes down.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="value-card reveal reveal-delay-1">
            <h3>Designed for Connection</h3>
            <p>The glow draws people in. Strangers walk over and ask to play. Friends stay out longer than they planned. That is not an accident -- every part of Frisbeam is built to lower the barrier and bring people together after dark, when the best conversations happen.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="value-card reveal reveal-delay-2">
            <h3>Built to Last</h3>
            <p>Rain, sand, travel, late nights that turn into early mornings -- your Frisbeam set handles all of it. Weather-resistant materials, rechargeable LEDs, and components tested through hundreds of hours of real-world play. Buy it once, glow forever.</p>

            <p>Behind Frisbeam is a small team that tests every product we sell, answers every customer message personally, and genuinely cares whether your night out was a good one. We are designers, engineers, and players -- and we would not have it any other way.</p>
            <p>We are based in the U.S., and every set ships from our own facility. When you reach out with a question or a wild idea for a new game mode, you are talking to someone who helped build what is lighting up your yard. That matters to us, and we think it matters to you too.</p>
