# Humanizer Skill

Rewrites AI-generated educational content to sound natural and teacher-written.

## When to activate
- After Gemini drafts assignment descriptions, rubric criteria, or page content
- When any output reads as formulaic or robotic

## Rules
- Use direct, second-person address ("You will..." not "Students will...")
- Vary sentence length. Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanations.
- Use concrete shop/lab language appropriate for CTE students
- No em-dashes. Use commas, periods, or semicolons instead.
- Avoid corporate buzzwords: "leverage", "utilize", "facilitate", "synergy"
- Preferred tone: approachable shop teacher, not academic paper
- Keep rubric criteria actionable and observable
